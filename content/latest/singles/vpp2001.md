# Fast Data Project’s Vector Packet Processor (VPP) Release 20.01

<br>
**SAN JOSE** –  FD.io (“Fido”) – an open source project within The Linux Foundation’s
LF Networking (LFN) – announced the availability of FD.io Vector Packet Processor (VPP)
software release 20.01.

With release 20.01 FD.io VPP includes multiple queue/core support with all it's drivers
including Linux TAPv2. End to end Generic Segment Offload (GSO) is also now supported.
The VPP host stack supports GSO for TCP and at the driver level, VPP supports GSO across
vmxnet3 on esxi, linux tap devices, and vhost-user devices for virtualization.

This significantly improves VPP interaction and performance with Linux, and container solutions
like Kubernetes. The same can be also said of the VPP interface with Virtual Machines whether
it be with vhost (QEMU) or vmxnet3 (VMware).

For an example of how using multiple queues/cores improve packet throughput let's examine these
impressive performance numbers from the Continuous System Integration and Test (CSIT) tests.

VPP performance is continuously being tested with the CSIT project. All the CSIT test reports
for the VPP 20.01 release are available at
[CSIT 20.01 Reports](https://s3-docs.fd.io/csit/master/report/).

IPsec performance numbers can be found at
[CSIT Crypto Tests](https://s3-docs.fd.io/csit/master/report/detailed_test_results/).

Notice the following impressive No Drop Rates (NDR) for IPv4 IPsec tunnels:

With 1 core and 1 thread we get:

* **1518 Byte Packets, 1 tunnel, 1 thread 1 core AES 256, NDR of 33.5 Gbps**
* **1518 Byte Packets, 10000 tunnel, 1 thread 1 core AES 256, NDR of 8.2 Gbps**

With 4 core and 4 threads the results are even better especially with 10000 tunnels.

* **1518 Byte Packets, 1 tunnel, 4 threads 4 cores AES 256, NDR of 37.7 Gbps**
* **1518 Byte Packets, 10000 tunnels, 4 threads 4 cores AES 256, NDR of 29.5 Gbps**

Once again VPP is moving packets faster than anyone thought possible.

With Release 20.01 VPP now supports QUIC. Rather than reinventing the wheel, VPP QUIC support
leverages the excellent Quickly library. VPP stays on the cutting edge of QUIC protocol development
without reinventing the wheel

The “data plane” experience of contributors from the VPP side enables very successful industry wide
cooperation. To date more than 30000 patches have been committed to the FD.io VPP project with over
400 contributers working through 90 organizations.

Interested in a healthy balance between the feature richness and the cutting-edge performance?
