The Fast Data Project (FD.io) Universal Dataplane is a collaborative open source
project that aims to significantly establish a high-performance IO services framework
for dynamic computing environments. The FD.io community brings a relentless focus
on data IO speed and efficiency in a modular environment. Industry-leading organizations
have joined FD.io to support the development of a modular and extensible IO services
framework. We invite you to collaborate with your industry peers to help build and shape
this technology. Participation in the FD.io technical community is open to all.

FD.io is a founding member of LF Networking (LFN), an entity that integrates the
governance of participating projects in order to improve operational efficiencies and simplify
member engagement. Each technical project retains its technical independence and project
roadmaps. Learn more about the FD.io [TSC](/community/tscdocs).

LFN software and projects provide platforms and building blocks for Network Infrastructure
and Services across Service Providers, Cloud Providers, Enterprises, Vendors, and System
Integrators that enable rapid interoperability, deployment, and adoption. LFN supports
the largest set of networking projects with the broadest community in the industry that
collaborate on this opportunity.
