This session delves into the high-performance world of Telco packet processing. We'll explore foundational technologies like DPDK, system partitioning, and deterministic setups, showcasing how they enable lightning-fast network processing. Moving beyond theory, weâ€™ll present a practical case featuring FD.io VPP, a standout example of a high-performance network function, and demonstrate how GCP and the Titanium architecture provide the infrastructure needed to build and deploy efficient, scalable, and robust Telco solutions-pushing the boundaries beyond 100 Mpps on commodity shared infrastructure.
