When we started integrating VPP in Kubernetes with [Calico](https://github.com/calico-vpp/calico-vpp/wiki)
as a management plane, the goal was to bring the performance of [VPP](http://localhost:1313/vppproject/vpptech/)
with the flexibility of userspace networking to containers. With its unrivaled IPsec performance,
this was clearly an area where [VPP](http://localhost:1313/vppproject/vpptech/) would be able to help. Without
further ado, here is the encrypted throughput we achieved between two pods on a 40G network
