**DAWN Internet - A New Dawn for the Internet** -- Imagine a shift from a centralized to a decentralized Internet
infrastructure—transforming who controls both connectivity and cloud infrastructure. What if this shift was not only
feasible but also immediately profitable? Each incremental change could save money and generate profit since it doesn’t
require enormous infrastructure investments. This article aims to make that case, centering on a pivotal development:
multi-gigabit wireless technology.

Wireless radios allow us to beam Internet through the air, at a fraction of the cost of alternatives like fiber.
And for the first time in history (2024), wireless matches fiber in terms of performance at the last-mile and exceeds
it in scalability, positioning it as a viable foundation for a new Internet. The question now is not about the technical
feasibility, but the how—the systems, business models, and user experiences that will drive the widespread adoption of
this technology to reclaim our Internet.

Central to this endeavor is the DAWN protocol—Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Networks. Developed by our team at
Andrena and already serving 10,000 households across 10 states with this technology, DAWN uses blockchain to create a
user-powered network of multi-gigabit wireless transmitters.
