As most of you may already know, QUIC is a new transport protocol that began
as a Google experiment for HTTP/2, which is now being standardized at the IETF.
It will also be the default transport protocol for HTTP/3. As a result, it is
likely to be very widely deployed in the next few years. Given the growing
popularity of QUIC and its expected widespread deployment, it was essential to
provide an implementation of QUIC in the Vector Packet Processor (VPP), both to
measure the performance that we could reach with a full userspace QUIC stack,
and as an enabler for more innovation around the QUIC protocol.
