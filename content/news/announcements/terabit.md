FD.io (“Fido”), relentlessly focused on data IO speed and efficiency supporting the creation of high performance, flexible, and scalable software defined infrastructures, today announced significant performance gains reaching terabit levels at multimillion route scale. Architectural improvement increases in latest Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor family – such as increased PCIe bandwidth – allow FD.io to double its performance at scale without modification to the software. Building on its recent 17.04 release, FD.io is the only vSwitch for which performance scaling is IO bound rather than CPU bound.
