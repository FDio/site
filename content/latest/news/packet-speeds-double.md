The open source Fast Data Project (FD.io) announced double performance gains made
possible by the latest IntelXeon Scalable processors. Intel’s new chips, which it announced
this week, are designed to support data center and networking workloads.

The FD.io group said the chips have helped it to double its vSwitch performance packet
speeds at scale without modification to the software.
