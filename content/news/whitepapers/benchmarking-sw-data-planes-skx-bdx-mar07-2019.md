The purpose of this technical paper is to show how the advancements in both, server
processor technology and data plane software, achieve new levels of deterministic
performance. It builds upon data plane benchmarking, analysis techniques and tools
described in [Benchmarking and Analysis of Software Data Planes](/docs/whitepapers/performance_analysis_sw_data_planes_dec21_2017.pdf)
and applying them to the same set of software applications (DPDK, FD.io VPP, OVS_DPDK).
