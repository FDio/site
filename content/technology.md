# Vector Packet Processing (VPP)

At the heart of FD.io is Vector Packet Processing (VPP).

In development since 2002, VPP is production code currently running in shipping
products. It runs in user space on multiple architectures including x86, ARM,
and Power architectures on both x86 servers and embedded devices. The design of
VPP is hardware, kernel, and deployment (bare metal, VM, container) agnostic. It
runs completely in userspace.

VPP helps FD.io push extreme limits of performance and scale. Independent testing shows that, at scale, VPP-powered FD.io is two orders of magnitude faster than currently available technologies.

VPP reads the largest available vector of packets from the network IO layer.

VPP then processes the vector of packets through a Packet Processing graph.
