FD.io TSC member [Ray Kinsella](https://fd.io/getinvolved/tsc/) has been
[blogging](https://ashroe.eu) recently on [FD.io VPP](https://fd.io). This
[latest post](https://ashroe.eu/2022/06/10/vpp-fat-binary-support.html)
describes how FD.io VPP auto-magically optimizes for the microprocessor
generation on which it is running. This means that optimizations can be
targeted at specific microprocessors, giving much finer granularity of
optimization and better overall performance.
