**IEEE Cluster 2020 Kobe** – The paper titled "CuVPP: Filter-based Longest Prefix
Matching in Software Data Planes" wins "Best Papers" award at
[IEEE Cluster 2020](https://clustercomp.org/2020/timetable/) on September 15th.

Programmability in network switches (or data planes) has become increasingly
important with increasing network virtualization in the Internet infrastructure
and large-scale data centers. A critical challenge in data plane programmability
is to maintain high-speed packet processing performance with ever increasing link
speed to hundreds of Gbps or Tbps. Another challenge is the rapid growing routing
table size, e.g., more than 500,000 entries.

We implement CuVPP as part of the **Real Software Switch VPP** and provide a comprehensive
evaluation using popular alternative approaches with realistic data sets for network
prefixes and traffic.
