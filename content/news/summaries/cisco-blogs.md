“Holy Sh*t, that’s fast and feature rich” is the most common response we’ve heard from folks that
have looked at some new code made available in OpenSource. A few weeks back, the Linux Foundation
launched a Collaborative Project called FD.io (“fido”). One of the foundational contributions to FD.io
is code that our engineering team wrote, called Vector Packet Processing or VPP for short. It was the
brainchild of a great friend and perhaps the best high performance network forwarding code designer
and author, Dave Barach.  He and the team have been working on it since 2002 and it’s on its third
complete rewrite (that’s a good thing!).
