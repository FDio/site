# Fast Data Project’s Vector Packet Processor (VPP) Release 20.01

## By Linux Foundation | San Francisco | January 21, 2020 

**SAN FRANCISCO** –  FD.io (“Fido”) – an open source project within The Linux Foundation’s
LF Networking (LFN), specifically focused on becoming the world’s packet processing data
plane form secure network infrastructure applications – today announced the availability
of VPP software release 20.01. The release provides significant additions and enhancements
to Vector Packet Processing (VPP) security and integration with Linux, Linux containers and
virtual machines. – furthering its breakthrough packet processing performance, security and usability.

## VPP Performance

The goal of the VPP project is always balancing the high performance with the sophisticated
functionality and advancing security - and this release kept up with the tradition.

The Continious System Integration and Test project (CSIT) is continously testing VPP for functional
and performance regressions. For all the CSIT reports visit [CSIT VPP IPV4 throughput report](https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/report/detailed_test_results/vpp_performance_results_2n_skx/vpp_performance_results_2n_skx.html).

Some of the NDR results for the VPP 20.01 release is as follows:

* IMIX Traffic, 4 threads, 2 cores, IPV4/IPV6 24 Routes about **6.6 MPPS**.
* IMIX Traffic, 4 threads, 2 cores, IPV4/IPV6 2M Routes also about **6.6 MPPS**.

When VPP is depolyed in a VM we get the following:

The detailed reports using KVM are here
[CSIT KVM Reports](https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/report/vpp_performance_tests/packet_throughput_graphs/vm_vhost-2n-skx-xxv710.html).

* IMIX Traffic, 2 threads, 1 core, VPP Cross connect, and vhost about **5.5 MPPS**

## Features

The features traditionally wanted by “heavy hitters” like GSO on <foo = rap, vmxnet3>, are complemented by <N>
commits pertaining to QUIC and TCP - a space that is normally terra incognita for a dataplane.

It’s worth noting that the QUIC support that VPP provides is done in collaboration with the Quicly project,
whose excellent library VPP uses to avoid reinventing the wheel, while staying on the bleeding edge.

But quic bringing the security to the table is not the only domain VPP is pursuing.

The IPsec might be discarded by some as not the most fashionable protocol, but it is very strong in the community
interest - as well as in the number of new developments: including the multi buffer library contributed by Intel,
which enables its users to fully utilize the existing performance  investment, by pipelining several encryption
operations at the same time and using the micro architecture parallelism to achive the non-trivial performance
improvement.

Some examples of IPSEC:

* IMIX Traffic, 2 Threads, 1 Core, IPV4 2M routes i40E about **3.7 MPPS**

## Contributions

Interested in a healthy balance between the feature richness and the cutting edge performance ?
Feel like you have this next big idea to test, but it seemed too daunting ? Join us by visiting
[FD.io Community](https://fd.io/community/join).

The “dataplane” experience of contributors from the VPP side enables a very successful cooperation - more
than <K> patches were upstreamed to quicly library based on the results of this integration just for this release alone.
