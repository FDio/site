# Fast Data Project’s Vector Packet Processor (VPP) Release 20.01

## By Andrew Yourtchenko, John DeNisco, Jerome Tollet, Ole Troan

**SAN JOSE** –  FD.io (“Fido”) – an open source project within The Linux Foundation’s
LF Networking (LFN), specifically focused on becoming the world’s packet processing data
plane for secure network infrastructure applications – announced the availability of FD.io
VPP software release 20.01. This release provides significant enhancements to Vector
Packet Processing (VPP) security, Linux, container and virtual machine interfaces. –
furthering its breakthrough packet processing performance and security.

With release 20.01 VPP supports multiple queues/cores and Generic Segment Offload (GSO)
from end to end. Meaning multiple queues/cores are included with all virtual interfaces.
GSO is included with the VPP TCP host stack, vmxnet3 on esxi, tap linux and vhosthuser
for virtualization.

This significantly improves VPP interaction and performance with Linux, and container solutions
like Kubernetes. The same can be also said of the VPP interface with Virtual Machines whether
it be with vhost (QEMU) or vmxnet3 (VMware).

For an example of how using multiple queues/cores improve packet throughput let's examine these
impressive performance numbers from the Continuous System Integration and Test (CSIT) tests.

VPP performance is continuously being tested with the CSIT project. All the CSIT test reports
for the VPP 20.01 release are available at
[CSIT 20.01 Reports](https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/report/).

IPsec performance numbers can be found at
[CSIT Crypto Tests](https://docs.fd.io/csit/master/report/detailed_test_results/vpp_performance_results_3n_hsw/vpp_performance_results_3n_hsw.html).

Notice the following impressive No Drop Rates (NDR) for IPv4 IPsec tunnels:

With 1 core and 1 thread we get:

* **1518 Byte Packets, 1 tunnel, 1 thread 1 core AES 256, NDR of 33.5 Gbps**
* **1518 Byte Packets, 10000 tunnel, 1 thread 1 core AES 256, NDR of 8.2 Gbps**

Not bad, but with 4 core and 4 threads look at these results:

* **1518 Byte Packets, 1 tunnel, 4 threads 4 cores AES 256, NDR of 37.7 Gbps**
* **1518 Byte Packets, 10000 tunnels, 4 threads 4 cores AES 256, NDR of 29.5 Gbps**

Once again VPP is moving packets faster than anyone thought possible.

The features traditionally wanted by “heavy hitters” like GSO on TCP, vhost, vmxnet3 and VPP
drivers, are complemented by <N> commits pertaining to QUIC and TCP - a space that is normally
terra incognita for a data plane.

It’s worth noting that the QUIC support that VPP provides is done in collaboration with the Quicly
project. By using this excellent library VPP uses avoids reinventing the wheel, while staying on
the bleeding edge.

QUIC bringing security to the table is not the only domain VPP is pursuing. IPsec might be
discarded by some as not the most fashionable protocol, but it is very strong in the community
interest - as well as in the number of new developments: including the multi buffer library
contributed by Intel. This library enables its users to fully utilize the existing performance
investment, by pipelining several encryption operations at the same time and using the micro
architecture parallelism to achieve the non-trivial performance improvement.

The “data plane” experience of contributors from the VPP side enables a very successful cooperation
– more than **K** patches were up streamed to the Quicly library just for this release. 

Interested in a healthy balance between the feature richness and the cutting-edge performance?
