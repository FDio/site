## Deployment Models

**FD.io is being used in Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and for Cloud Native Functions (CNFs) for example:**


### <img src="/img/logos/openstack02.png" width=10% > Virtual Network Functions
**Openstack support is provided with [Networking VPP](https://opendev.org/x/networking-vpp) or [Open Daylight](https://www.opendaylight.org) as your OpenStack Neutron ML2 Driver.**

<!-- original "networking VPP" link: https://github.com/openstack/networking-vpp -->

### <img src="/img/usecases/docker.png" width=10% > Cloud Network Functions

**Kubernetes and Container support is provided as a CNI extension with [Calico/VPP](https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/vpp/getting-started)**

You can use it by configure the Calico CNI to use VPP as its dataplane.

<!-- Previous projects addressing this were [Ligato](https://ligato.io/) and [Contiv/VPP](https://github.com/contiv/vpp) as your Kubernetes CNI providers. -->
