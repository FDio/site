Cisco has been developing the technology it believes can deliver networks on
demand: It recently open sourced a virtual switch and router, the Vector Packet
Processor, to the recently formed FD.io community to provide network operators
with a modular and high-performance infrastructure using existing Intel Corp.
(Nasdaq: INTC)-based systems. The VPP supports 480Gbit/s throughput in 24 cores,
with another 48 available. “It’s pretty much everything you need to deploy a virtual
network and it’s screamingly fast,” Ward says.
