[Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (hICN)] (https://wiki.fd.io/view/HICN) is a new way of thinking about networking that we are bringing to FD.io. With hICN,  communications are centered around the “what” instead of the “where,” and the core network principles are pivoted toward this core idea.
