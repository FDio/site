High-Performance Cloud Networking With Calico and Vector Packet Processing - Shatakshi Mishra & Abed Mohammad Kamaluddin, Marvell Technology

In cloud-native environments, high-performance networking is crucial for scalability and security. Calico, a leading solution for container networking, integrates the VPP dataplane alongside eBPF. VPP provides a scalable solution combining security with high-performance packet processing. In this session, we’ll discuss our work with Calico’s VPP dataplane, optimized by integrating Marvell’s high-performance native plugin, an open-source Data Acceleration Offload solution. This integration offloads cryptographic tasks and inline IPSec encryption to SmartNICs, reducing CPU usage and optimizing secure data transmission. VPP offers fast packet processing, low latency, and high throughput, essential for service meshes, edge computing, and microservices. By leveraging hardware offloading and optimizations, VPP enhances throughput and reduces CPU load, making it ideal for demanding networking tasks. We’ll present benchmark results showcasing improved throughput, latency, and resource use.
