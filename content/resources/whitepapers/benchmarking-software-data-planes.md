This technical paper introduces the main concepts underpinning a systematic
methodology for benchmarking and analysis of compute-native network SW data plane
performance running on modern compute server HW. It applies first principles of
computer science to performance measurements, describing involved aspects of SW-HW
integration and focusing on the optimal usage of compute HW resources critical to the
data plane performance.
