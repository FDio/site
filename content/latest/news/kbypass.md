In this blog We will compare the result with the results of my
[last blog](https://medium.com/@atoonk/linux-kernel-and-measuring-network-throughput-547c3b68c4d2?source=friends_link&sk=b8a74c58f8b7a0d998a8796410b3fb96)
in which we looked at how much a vanilla Linux kernel could do in terms of forwarding (routing)
packets. We observed that on Linux, to achieve 14Mpps we needed roughly 16 and 26 cores for a
unidirectional and bidirectional test. In this article, weâ€™ll look at what we need to
accomplish this with FD.io
