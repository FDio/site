**Stonework** -- As Telecommunications companies continue their journey of network transformation, network functions virtualization (NFV) based on white box cloud computing infrastructure has started to make way for cloud native network functions (CNFs) based on container infrastructure running on commodity hardware. However, the performance requirements of telecom networking can not be satisfied by the Linux kernel alone in container environments – data and control planes are crucial to the proper functioning of networking infrastructure such as routers and switches.

PANTHEON.tech tackled this problem with their open-source product, StoneWork, a high performance data plane and a modular control plane that is built with on top of open source software – Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK, a Linux Foundation project) and vector packet processing (VPP) by FD.io (a Linux Foundation Networking project) and Ligato, an open-source management agent – among other software, and provides an efficient framework for building, deploying, and managing CNF applications.
