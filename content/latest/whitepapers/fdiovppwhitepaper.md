What is VPP? Is it a software router? A virtual switch? A virtual network function?
Or, something else? In fact it is all of the above and a whole lot more. It is a
modularized and extensible software framework for building bespoke network data plane
applications. And equally importantly, VPP code is written for modern CPU compute
platforms (x86_64, ARMv8, PowerPC, to name a few), with a great deal of care and focus
given to optimizing the software- hardware interface for real-time, network I/O operations
and packet processing.
