The Linux Foundation’s Fast Data (FD.io, or Fido) collaborative software project is
touting a set of new performance gains that it says will reach terabit levels to
accommodate multiple deployment environments, including bare metal, virtual machine (VM) and container.

Similar to the way business users can order compute and storage on demand, FD.io is
designed to enable service providers to offer on-demand network services. These services
could include everything from dialing up bandwidth for a specific period, routing or firewall resources.
