Learn how FD.io is used to build secure Terabit NaaS cloud
networking, a.k.a. SASE, and FD.io VPP and CSIT projects' critical
roles in this. FD.io project is industry leading in providing
production-ready open-source technologies and tooling to build secure
and fast modern cloud VPNs, including support of encrypted overlays
such as IPsec, TLS, QUIC, WireGuard and more.

In this talk, you will learn:

i. How FD.io VPP achieves near-linear
multi-core horizontal scaling and leverages platform optimizations to
achieve Terabit speeds; 

ii. How FD.io CSIT benchmarking methodologies
and tooling ensure the consistency of performance and robustness of
Terabit-ready product built with FD.io VPP technologies and 

iii. How these came together recently on an Intel Xeon Icelake scalable
processor family to break the barrier of Terabit rate IPsec on a single
dual-socketed Intel Platform (with zero frame loss).
