The Linux Foundation’s Fast Data (FD.io) is an open source project established
earlier this year with the aim of building a cross-platform I/O services framework
so that developers can rapidly develop the sort of high-throughput, low latency
services that are required for (amongst other things) Network Functions
Virtualisation (NFV). FD.io (Fido) is hardware-, kernel-, and deployment-agnostic
so can run on physical servers, virtual machines and containers.

This distinguished panel – brought together at a recent Intel Network Partner
Builders Day – discussed the vision and scope of the project, how it relates
to and complements other open source efforts and where FD.io members are taking
it in terms of proposed work items.
