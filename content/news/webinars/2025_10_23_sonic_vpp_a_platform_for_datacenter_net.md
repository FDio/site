This talk will follow up on key SONiC-VPP improvements, highlighting how weve ensured greater community usability since its initial release. We have enhanced SONiC-VPP with crucial features to enable an IP-BGP network ensuring its integration and validation against the SonicMgmt test frameworks, particularly for critical T0-T1 roles.We will share enhancements made to the core infrastructure, new features supported with improved dataplane and control plane capabilities. Furthermore, we will showcase the end-to-end packaging and build functionalities, empowering anyone to host and deploy SONiC-VPP within diverse cloud environments.Looking ahead we will also present a rich roadmap, detailing our development plan to drive broader adoption and unlock other compelling use cases for SONiC-VPP.
