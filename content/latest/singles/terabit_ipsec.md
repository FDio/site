## FD.io VPP breaks the 1 Tbit/s IPsec and 1 Billion pkts/s barriers on new 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors

FD.io (“Fido”), relentlessly focused on data IO speed and efficiency supporting the creation of high performance, 
flexible, and scalable software defined infrastructures, today announced support for terabit rates of IPsec, as well
as a billion packets per second of IPv4 routing at scale.  Architectural improvements in 3rd Gen
Intel Xeon Scalable processors including PCIe bandwidth increase and overall decrease in cycles-per-packet due to 
CPU micro-architecture improvements allow FD.io to deliver significant price-performance gains for both cloud- and
appliance-based software router and secure networking solutions.

FD.io offers the software defined infrastructure developer community a landing site with multiple projects fostering 
innovations in software-based packet processing towards the creation of high-throughput, low-latency, and
resource-efficient I/O services suitable to many architectures (x86, ARM, and PowerPC) and deployment environments
(bare-metal, VM, container).

Vector Packet Processing (VPP), a key project component of FD.io, designed with server-class optimizations such as
vector instructions, excellent cache usage and packet pre-fetching, achieves world-class performance when connected
to I/O physical and virtual devices. The VPP framework gives developers the potential to easily build any number of packet processing solutions by varying the underlying forwarding graphs while also easily accommodating new graph nodes to be “plugged in.”

Testing details of the recent FD.io code showing terabit rates with IPsec, as well as a
billion packets per second of IPv4 routing are found [here](/presentations/Fdio-Icelake-Demo-v11i.pdf) along with accompanying [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipQQmjzE_g0).

### About FD.io
The Fast Data Project (FD.io) “Fido” is a collaborative open source project that aims to establish a high-performance IO services framework for dynamic computing environments. The FD.io Community includes Network IO, Packet Processing, and Dataplane Management Agents fostering innovations in software based packet processing towards the creation of high-throughput, low-latency and resource-eﬃcient IO services suitable to many architectures (x86, ARM, and PowerPC) and deployment environments (bare-metal, VM, container).
