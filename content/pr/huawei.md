FD.io (“Fido”), relentlessly focused on data IO speed and efficiency supporting the creation of high-performance, flexible, and scalable software-defined infrastructures, today announced Huawei as the newest Platinum member. Huawei’s upgrade from Gold to Platinum demonstrates both the project’s and Huawei’s commitment to pursuing faster, more open and innovative software-based packet processing.

FD.io offers the software-defined infrastructure developer community a landing site with multiple projects fostering innovations in software-based packet processing toward the creation of high-throughput, low-latency, and resource-efficient IO services suitable to many architectures (x86, ARM, and PowerPC) and deployment environments (bare metal, VM, container). Created to address gaps that exist in the open networking stack to deliver dynamic data plane services for dynamic computing environments such as cloud, containers, and network functions virtualization (NFV), the design of FD.io is hardware, kernel, and deployment (bare metal, VM, container) agnostic.

“As a leading contributor to FD.io already, Huawei’s upgraded Platinum membership brings additional resources and innovation to the project,” said Chenxi Wang, FD.io Board Member and VP, Network Strategy and Ecosystem, Huawei. “One of our focuses is to build a sound ecosystem with our community partners in order to enable Cloud Native Networking, and we truly believe that community collaboration will drive FD.io to a new level.”

Huawei’s Platinum upgrade comes following the project’s recent Mini Summit, co-located with CloudNativeCon + KubeCon North America, held in Austin, Texas, on December 5. Slides and video content from the event–which included presentations from FD.io community experts on related projects, use cases, capabilities, tools, and integration between FD.io and other open source communities–will be available in the coming weeks via the FD.io website.
