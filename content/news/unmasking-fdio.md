The Fast Data Project (FD.io) is a networking open source project whose scope
includes software-based packet processing, fast Input/Output (IO), and universal
data plane management across bare metal, hypervisor, and container environments.

FD.io, which was open-sourced by the Linux Foundation in February 2016, was garnering
quite a lot of attention at the recent Open Networking Summit (ONS) 2017 in Santa Clara,
California.

A key component of FD.io is the Vector Packet Processing (VPP) software donated by
Cisco at the inception of the project. This code is already running in products on the market today.
