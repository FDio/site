GoVPP is a Golang toolset for VPP management. It consists of a set of Golang packages that provide the API for VPP management based on the Go bindings generated from the VPP binary APIs. It can be used as the foundation for any VPP management/control plane written in Go.

Apart from the packages providing the API and tools allowing to write VPP management applications in Go from scratch, the project also aims to provide a cloud-native VPP management agent that can be used in VPP-based container infrastructure.
