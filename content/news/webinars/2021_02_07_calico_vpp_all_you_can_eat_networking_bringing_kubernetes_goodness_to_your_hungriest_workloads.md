There are classes of workloads that are notoriously hungry when it comes to networking. Think big data, storage, analytics, 5G, virtual network functions, then encrypt it all at 40Gbps line rates. Kubernetes and the Kubernetes network model are increasingly seen as essential to help manage these workloads at scale. But the cost of containerization and container networking can be hard to swallow for workloads that are often used to having dedicated NICs and physical hardware. Our novel solution was to cook up a feast that is a fusion of two worlds: combining Calico, the popular cloud native Kubernetes network plugin, with VPP, a very fast and scalable userspace packet processing software. In this talk we will lift the lid on what weâ€™ve been cooking and the key ingredients that made it possible to offer an all you can eat buffet for your hungriest workloads.
