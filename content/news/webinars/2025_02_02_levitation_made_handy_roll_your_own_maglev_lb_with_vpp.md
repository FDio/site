## Levitation made handy: 
### Roll your own Maglev LB with VPP !


Horizontal scaling is nice, but keeping state is not. Enters Maglev [0] that offers
the best of both worlds ! But one does not get to run it without a fair supply of
pain killers.

This talk claims otherwise !

We will cover how Malgev works, why it makes sense to use it, how to write a simple 
VPP [1] agent, and make run it on commodity hardware. Packets will fly !
