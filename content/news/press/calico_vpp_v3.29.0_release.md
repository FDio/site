**Networking and Security Enhancements in Calico v3.29.0 release on 29th of October 2024** -- It’s almost time for
KubeCon North America, and we’re excited to share the latest updates in Calico. These updates improve network and
runtime security, make it easier to use, and extend Calico’s strong network security and observability for Kubernetes
to VMs and hosts that are not part of Kubernetes clusters. Whether you’re managing Kubernetes clusters, transitioning
to a new Linux data plane, or seeking a unified network security solution across your Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes
workloads on-premises or in the cloud, Calico’s latest enhancements have you covered.
