Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (hICN) is a network architecture that makes use of IPv6 or IPv4 to realize location-independent communications.

It is largely inspired by the pioneer work of Van Jacobson on Content-Centric Networking, that was a clean-slate architecture whereas hICN is based on the Internet protocol and easy to deploy in today networks and applications. hICN brings many-to-many communications, multi-homing, multi-path, multi-source, group communications to the Internet protocol without replicated unicast.

The project implements novel transport protocols, with a socket API, for real-time and capacity seeking applications. A scalable stack is available based on VPP and a client stack is provided to support any mobile and desktop operating system.
